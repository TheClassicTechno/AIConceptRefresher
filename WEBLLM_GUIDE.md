- **No APIs**: No external servers or API keys needed
- **Privacy First**: All AI processing happens locally
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet after initial download

### **Model Details**
- **Model**: Llama 3.2 1B Instruct (Quantized for Web)
- **Size**: ~1.2GB (downloads automatically)
- **Speed**: Fast inference on modern browsers
- **Capabilities**: Text generation, Q&A, educational content

## Requirements

### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Chrome 113+** (recommended)
- **Firefox 115+** 
- **Safari 16.6+**
- **Edge 113+**

### **System Requirements**
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for model caching
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor
- **GPU**: WebGPU support (optional but faster)

## Features

### **AI Lab Chat**
1. **Navigate to AI Lab** in the top menu
2. **Wait for AI to load** (first time takes 2-5 minutes)
3. **Chat with the AI** for personalized learning help
4. **Generate questions** on any topic
5. **Get explanations** for complex concepts

### **Smart Quiz Features**
- **AI-Generated Questions**: 30% of quiz questions come from the AI
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: AI adjusts based on your performance
- **Intelligent Feedback**: Personalized explanations and encouragement
- **Learning Tips**: Contextual study suggestions

## Setup Instructions

### **First Time Setup**
1. **Open the website** in a compatible browser
2. **Wait for AI initialization** (you'll see a loading indicator)
3. **Model downloads automatically** (be patient, it's worth it!)
4. **Test in AI Lab** once loading completes

### **Troubleshooting**

#### **If AI doesn't load:**
```
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Ensure you have enough RAM available
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check internet connection for initial download
```

#### **If loading is slow:**
```
1. Close other browser tabs to free RAM
2. Wait patiently - first load takes time
3. Subsequent loads are much faster (cached)
4. Consider using Chrome for best performance
```

#### **If you get fallback mode:**
```
- Don't worry! The site still works great
- You'll get simulated AI responses
- Try reloading when you have more resources
- All core features remain functional
```

## Usage Tips

### **Best Practices**
- **Keep questions focused** for better AI responses
- **Be specific** about what you want to learn
- **Try different subjects** to see AI's versatility
- **Use quick prompts** for common requests

### **Example Prompts**
```
"Generate a Data Structures question about binary trees"
"Explain how machine learning algorithms work"
"Create a study plan for learning algorithms"
"What's the best way to understand recursion?"
```

### **Performance Tips**
- **Close unused tabs** to maximize available RAM
- **Use Chrome** for optimal WebGPU support
- **Be patient** on first load - it gets faster!
- **Keep the tab active** during model loading
